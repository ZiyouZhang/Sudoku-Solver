Summarise your findings here (see specification).

Answer:
Sudoku board in mystery1.dat: extremely hard
Sudoku board in mystery2.dat: impossible to solve
Sudoku board in mystery3.dat: hard

Reasoning:
An overloaded function solve_board(char board[9][9], int& recursion_count) was declared and defined.
This funciton keeps track of the recursion times while solving the sudoku board recursively.
Higher recursion count indicates higher complexity.
The recursion counts are as follows:

Sudoku board in mystery1.dat: 421547
Sudoku board in mystery2.dat: 11533 (but no solution was found)
Sudoku board in mystery3.dat: 14134
